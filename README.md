# [WIP] sing-rivert

sing-rivert is a combination of the words 'sing-box', 'ribet', and 'convert'. 

'ribet' is an Indonesian term meaning complicated or impractical. This name was chosen because many users find configuring sing-box to be complicated.

The goal is to enabling everyone, including novice users, to easily set up sing-box configuration.

The configuration generated by sing-rivert is compatible with various sing-box based applications, including:

- sing-box for Android (SFA)
- sing-box for iOS (SFI)
- Box for Root (BFM)
